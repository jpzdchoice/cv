        I am currently working as a Radio Frequency Engineer at Samsung Electronics America. At Samsung our team is working with Verizon to migrate the baseband units over from other vendors to Samsung baseband units.  My task is analyze and troubleshoot the network after migration, and correct LTE 4G network nodes in the Upstate New York Market. This includes improving network performance for the sites we migrated and surrounding sites. This job has been a big challenge and very rewarding. I learned how to use Samsung's UML interface to correct issues that arose and make network parameter changes. My contract for Samsung is tenatively ending March 2020. Before this postion I worked as a contractor for T-Mobile. At T-Mobile I was placed in charge of network performance in the Costal North Carolina Area. This is area emcompassed all of the T-Mobile's network east of I-95 in North Carolina. I also helped out in the Raleigh North Carolina market as well. I am very proud of my accomplishments here because at the completion of my contract I saw signficant network performance improvements for my area. T-Mobile is a great company to work for; I really enjoyed my time working with the network team in Charlotte, North Carolina. I kept a screenshot of all the KPIs improvements in my responsible area to remind me of this accomplshment during this time because I take pride in a job well done. Before that I worked for Verizon for 16 years in various IT and network engineering roles. Network engineering is moving toward automation, so I am currently sharpening my coding skills. So far I have learned Java, C#, Javascript, and Web Programming. Creating solutions using code has been a passion since I was very young. I am very glad I am learning  software development and finding opportunities to put this new skill set to use.
